Saves on your wrists from doing the mouse-shuffle :-)\r\n===============\r\n\r\n## IBM iSeries Menu System - a mouse-free alternative\r\nBased on the foundations of the IBM mid-range idea. A menu of options can be picked more easily by using a number that's shwon before the menu item description.\r\n\r\nThis app uses similar function key combinations as seen on IBM mid-range systems. More custom menus can be built by any notepad or edit program that does not decorate the text with styling such as bold, etc. \r\n\r\nFunction key one is the menu help key and will bring up a web page with more details than we can describe here.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
