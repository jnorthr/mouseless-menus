<h1>Mouseless Menu System</h1>
<h2>Apologies</h2> 
<p>This is my first GitHub project. It is a learning curve that i've found to be rather steep. Please bear with me or better yet, send suggestions.</p>

<p>This upload is the initial preview of a little menu system that's written as a groovy testbed with some java source thrown in.</p>

<p>It is based on the menu systems we have on IBM iSeries mainframes. It uses function keys rather than a mouse. It mimics the 5250 green screen we typically find on older IBM kit. This approach is more effective for touch-typist, who prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard, rather than shuffle between mouse and keyboard.</p>

<h2>Not A Shell</h2>
<p>This app is <b>NOT</b> a bash shell. It does not hold state across commands. You cannot change directories unless that is done before Menus starts. You cannot use the bash shell expansion characters like * to gain a full list of matching objects. So something like 'ls -al *.java' will NOT filter your list of files. It just reports the file *.java as not found.</p>

<pre>
Function Key Usage - like IBM 5250 specifications
F1 - Help
F2 - Toggles ability to copy text from console message output at bottom of display.
F3 - End menus and exit
F5 - Refresh current menu, for example if you change the menu text file outside the menu system and want to reload the updated menu.
F9 - Recall prior command on command line - similar to up arrow key in bash shell.
F10 &amp; F12 - backstep key; use this to return to a prior menu level above the current level. Both keys do the same as some keyboards may not have an F12 key.
</pre>

<p>Menus are normal text files created with a simple text editor. Each menu entry is placed on a single line of the text file. Each line ends with a cr/lf character pair. These files are placed into a sub-folder of the menu directory. This sub-folder is external to this module and can be changed by you. It is not fixed in stone. </p>

<p>A menu entry is composed of two parts divided by the := separator. Text to the left of the := pair appears on the menu entry, while text on the right of the := pair is treated as a command string to be executed. How is the command string executed ? Each menu entry is assigned a number when building the panel before it is displayed. So by keying that number on the command line, the command text for the matching entry is executed.</p>

<h2>Mouseless Menu Sample</h2>
<p>For example, if we have a text file named 'abc.txt' containing lines like :</p>
<pre>
What is the current PATH variable:=echo $PATH
Display the Java Compiler Version:=javac -version
Display A Menu of Network Commands:=go network
</pre>
<p>the display would appear as :
<pre>
1. What is the current PATH variable
2. Display the Java Compiler Version
3. Display A Menu of Network Commands
Enter menu # or command : ________________________  
</pre>

<p>with the text cursor focused on the underline text entry field. If we key the number 2 and press the enter key, a sub-process is started with the command 'javac -version'. Results from the standard and error output streams return to, and are displayed in the audit trail panel below the panel of menu choices.</p>

<h2>Built-In Commands</h2>

<p>There are also several builtin commands within the menu system. Only the 'go' command is covered here. This 'builtin' command will load menu choices from another text file found in the same sub-folder directory. In the above example, keying the number 3 plus the enter key, asks the menu system to look for and if possible, load another set of menu choices from ./network.txt</p>

<p>It's all like a short-hand way to key a single number plus enter key to cause a system action, rather than typing or re-typing any long and/or complex commands over and over again. Two keystrokes rather than 30 or 40 keystrokes. Saves time.</p>

<h2>More About The Menus</h2>
<p>Continuing with this example, assume we are now looking at a set of network menu entries. The F10 and F12 function keys can be used as a backstep feature to return to the prior menu we saw before the network menu, or 'abc.txt' in this case. There is no limit to menu depth, so we could have main menu call network menu call wireless menu to reach a menu item there. We can drill down into more and more specific functionality.</p><p>Once completed, the F12 or F10 key can be used to walk back thru previous menus. There is no difference between F10 and F12. Both behave identically. Both walk back up the list of visited menus.</p>

<p>The F9 function key works in the same way to walk back thru all of the prior commands entered. It mimics the bash shell 'up-arrow' feature to recall previous commands. When the command is visible on the command line, it can be changed if necessary. The enter key will cause that command to execute. </p>

<h2>More Notes About Menu Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>On command line, enter a command or the number of an option to execute.</li>
<li>Copy, cut and paste is available on the command line.</li>
<li>On Mac O/S systems, you may need to start your task with the word 'command', such as 'command echo $JAVA_HOME'</li>

<li>edit ./data/menu.txt to add/modify commands</li>
<li>You can use URL addresses from command lines, browser address bars or as a menu.txt item like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">www.bbc.co.uk</a> or http://www.bbc.co.uk</li>
<li>Commands like ls -al *.java  will not give expected results as *.java is a shell expansion feature to return all files</li>
